# Monte Carlo Simulation Code
Working on making a monte-carlo code. Currently its working for simple calculations. Its intended use is only educational.

Next step is to confirm the results against an already established code to ensure they are within the same order of magnitude at least.

The only external requirements so far are numpy and h5py.

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- h5py

**Installation**:
```bash
pip install -e .
